# pianoGame

This is a game inspired with Simon-style games. However, it uses actual piano sounds and keyboard. The game plays a sequence of sounds and highlights each key, and the player must repeat the sequence; it starts with one sound and gets longer each time the player repeats the sequence correctly.
